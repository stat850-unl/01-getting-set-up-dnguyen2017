Hi everyone!


I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Biology and as well as an incoming student in the Statistics masters program. My research interests are in how to fuse data and models to support decision-making for managing ecological and epidemiological systems.


I use windows and have experience using R. However, I don't have much practical experience working with real data or doing statistical analyses - most of my previous work was doing data-free theoretical work (lots of simulations). I'm really excited to learn better computing practices since I'm mostly self-taught.


I've enjoyed reading everyone's introductions and it's cool to see how diverse everyone's backgrounds are. Looking forward to meeting you all in person!


Cheers,

David
